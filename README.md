# Aiym Temirbayeva - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, My name is Aiym! I am an aspiring data analyst with a background in business analysis and a specialized college degree. During my bachelor's degree I was most interested in SQL, and after graduation I decided to develop in this direction. That's why I enrolled in a master's program in Data Analytics. I am developing my skills in Python and SQL by taking courses from Skillbox and other educational platforms. Already well versed in Python, pandas library and SQL, and currently looking to further explore PowerBI and other data visualization tools.

My strengths include the ability to work in a team, quick learner and independence in finding solutions.
